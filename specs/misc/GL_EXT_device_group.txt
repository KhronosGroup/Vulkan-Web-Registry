Overview

    This extension adds a builtin input variable containing the device
    index.

New Procedures and Functions

    None.

New Tokens

    None.


Modifications to the OpenGL Shading Language Specification, Version 4.50

    Including the following line in a shader can be used to control the
    language features described in this extension:

        #extension GL_EXT_device_group : <behavior>

    where <behavior> is as specified in section 3.3

    New preprocessor #defines are added to the OpenGL Shading Language:

        #define GL_EXT_device_group     1

    Modify Section 7.1 (Built-In Language Variables), p. 118

    Add to the list of vertex, tessellation control, tessellation
    evaluation, geometry, fragment, and compute shader built-ins:

        highp int gl_DeviceIndex;

    Add the following description for gl_DeviceIndex:

    The input variable gl_DeviceIndex is available in all shading languages
    and corresponds to the DeviceIndex SPIR-V input. See the Vulkan API
    specification for how this value is interpreted.

Errors

    None.
