    This extension adds a builtin input variable containing the view index.

New Procedures and Functions

    None.

New Tokens

    None.


Modifications to the OpenGL Shading Language Specification, Version 4.50

    Including the following line in a shader can be used to control the
    language features described in this extension:

        #extension GL_EXT_multiview : <behavior>

    where <behavior> is as specified in section 3.3

    New preprocessor #defines are added to the OpenGL Shading Language:

        #define GL_EXT_multiview     1

    Modify Section 7.1 (Built-In Language Variables), p. 118

    Add to the list of vertex, tessellation control, tessellation
    evaluation, geometry, and fragment shader built-ins:

        highp int gl_ViewIndex;

    Add the following description for gl_ViewIndex:

    The input variable gl_ViewIndex is available in vertex, tessellation,
    geometry, and fragment shading languages and corresponds to the
    ViewIndex SPIR-V input. See the Vulkan API specification for how this
    value is interpreted.

Errors

    None.
