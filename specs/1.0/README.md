# Landing page for Vulkan apispec.html and apispec.pdf documents

This page replaces the single-page Vulkan 1.0 reference page compilations,
formerly published at URLs
https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.0/apispec.html
and
https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.0/apispec.pdf

These single-page documents were compilations of the individual Vulkan 1.0
reference pages. With Vulkan 1.1 released, all the individual 1.0 reference
page URLs on the Khronos website have been redirected to the corresponding
1.1 reference page. However, we have chosen to not publish 1.1 versions of
the single-page documents, as they are larger than the full
Vulkan 1.1 Specification, while containing less information (due to all the
reference page boilerplate).

However, it is still possible to download the
https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Docs/ repository and generate your
own version of the 1.1 single-page documents, using the 'manhtml' and
'manpdf' targets.

If you require the 1.0 single-page documents, or the 1.0 individual
reference pages, they are all still in the Github
repository backing the registry, at commit
https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Web-Registry/commit/f65b2bd57eb49bc694899b4f34856b0cdcd54321
